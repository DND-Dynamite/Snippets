"**JDWP-Handshake**" usually refers to an error or issue that occurs when trying to connect to a Java application using the **Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP)**. This protocol is part of the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA), and it‚Äôs used by tools (like IDEs) to attach to and debug running Java applications.

### üîç What Causes a `JDWP-Handshake` Error?

You might see something like:

```
JDWP exit error AGENT_ERROR_TRANSPORT_INIT(197): JDWP Transport dt_socket failed to initialize
JDWP-Handshake failed
```

This typically happens because:

1. **Port Issues**
    
    - The JDWP port is already in use.
        
    - A firewall or security group is blocking the port.
        
2. **Connection Mismatch**
    
    - You‚Äôre trying to attach a debugger to a process that isn‚Äôt started in debug mode.
        
    - The client expects a JDWP server, but the server isn't listening (or vice versa).
        
3. **Wrong Protocol or Address**
    
    - Using the wrong transport (e.g., `dt_socket` vs `dt_shmem` on Windows).
        
    - Connecting to the wrong IP/port.
        
4. **Application Didn't Start with Debug Enabled**
    
    - If the Java process wasn‚Äôt started with `-agentlib:jdwp=...`, there won‚Äôt be a JDWP handshake.

### ‚úÖ How to Fix It

#### If you're the **one starting the Java application**, make sure it includes debug options:

```sh
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005
```

- `transport=dt_socket`: Uses socket transport.
    
- `server=y`: Runs as a debug server.
    
- `suspend=n`: Application doesn‚Äôt wait for debugger to attach.
    
- `address=*:5005`: Listens on port 5005 (change as needed).
    

#### If you‚Äôre the **client/IDE trying to connect**:

- Ensure the application is running with JDWP enabled.
    
- Make sure the IP and port are correct.
    
- Check for firewalls blocking the connection.
    
- Make sure the port is open and listening.
