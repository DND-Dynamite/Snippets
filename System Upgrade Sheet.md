For your **HP Pavilion Laptop 15-cc1xx** with an Intel Core i5-8250U, the most effective and low-cost upgrades focus on **RAM** and **storage**. Upgrading the CPU is not feasible, as it is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be replaced[1](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Can-i-upgrade-my-cpu-from-a-core-i5-8250u-to-a-core-i7-7700k/td-p/7847990)2.

**Here are the optimal, budget-friendly upgrade options:**

## 1. RAM Upgrade

- **Maximum Supported:** Up to **64GB DDR4** (2 slots, 32GB per slot)[3](https://www.compuram.biz/memory/hp-hpe/notebook/pavilion/series/hp-pavilion-laptop-15-cc1xx/32gb-1c919aa-1c919at-118f5.htm)[4](https://www.compuram.biz/memory/hp-hpe/notebook/pavilion/series/hp-pavilion-laptop-15-cc1xx/).
    
- **Recommended for Most Users:** Upgrade to **16GB** (2 x 8GB) or **32GB** (2 x 16GB) for a significant boost in multitasking, gaming, and productivity.
    
- **How to Upgrade:** RAM slots are accessible via the bottom cover. Use compatible DDR4 SO-DIMM 2666MHz modules[3](https://www.compuram.biz/memory/hp-hpe/notebook/pavilion/series/hp-pavilion-laptop-15-cc1xx/32gb-1c919aa-1c919at-118f5.htm)[4](https://www.compuram.biz/memory/hp-hpe/notebook/pavilion/series/hp-pavilion-laptop-15-cc1xx/).
    
- **Estimated Cost:** 8GB modules start around ₹2,500–₹3,000 each; 16GB modules are higher, but 16GB total is sufficient for most tasks[4](https://www.compuram.biz/memory/hp-hpe/notebook/pavilion/series/hp-pavilion-laptop-15-cc1xx/).
    

## 2. SSD Upgrade

- **NVMe SSD:** Your laptop supports **M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDs** up to at least **1TB**[5](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hard-drive-upgrade-to-NVMe-SSD-1TB-for-HP-Pavilion-15-cc1xx/td-p/7881517).
    
    - This will dramatically improve boot times, application loading, and overall responsiveness.
        
    - You can keep your existing hard drive for extra storage if you wish.
        
- **How to Upgrade:** Install the NVMe SSD in the M.2 slot. If you want it as the boot drive, you may need to clone your current OS or perform a clean install[5](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hard-drive-upgrade-to-NVMe-SSD-1TB-for-HP-Pavilion-15-cc1xx/td-p/7881517)2.
    
- **Estimated Cost:** 500GB NVMe SSDs start around ₹3,000–₹4,000; 1TB models are more but offer more space[5](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hard-drive-upgrade-to-NVMe-SSD-1TB-for-HP-Pavilion-15-cc1xx/td-p/7881517).
    

## 3. Additional Storage (Optional)

- If you need more space, you can add a **2.5" SATA SSD** or HDD in addition to the NVMe SSD2.
    
- Use the SATA bay for a secondary drive, ideal for storing large files, games, or backups2.
    

## 4. What You Cannot Upgrade

- **CPU and GPU:** Both are soldered to the motherboard and cannot be upgraded[1](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Can-i-upgrade-my-cpu-from-a-core-i5-8250u-to-a-core-i7-7700k/td-p/7847990)2.
    
- **Motherboard Swap:** Technically possible but not cost-effective or practical; not recommended[1](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Can-i-upgrade-my-cpu-from-a-core-i5-8250u-to-a-core-i7-7700k/td-p/7847990).
    

## Suggested Upgrade Path (Low Cost, High Impact)

|Upgrade|Benefit|Approximate Cost (INR)|Recommendation|
|---|---|---|---|
|8GB → 16GB RAM|Smoother multitasking|2,500–6,000|Strongly recommended|
|Add NVMe SSD|Fast boot and app load times|3,000–6,000|Strongly recommended|
|Add SATA SSD|Extra storage|2,500–4,000|Optional|

**Summary of Steps:**

1. Upgrade RAM to at least 16GB for smooth multitasking[3](https://www.compuram.biz/memory/hp-hpe/notebook/pavilion/series/hp-pavilion-laptop-15-cc1xx/32gb-1c919aa-1c919at-118f5.htm)[4](https://www.compuram.biz/memory/hp-hpe/notebook/pavilion/series/hp-pavilion-laptop-15-cc1xx/).
    
2. Install an NVMe SSD (500GB or 1TB) for a major speed boost[5](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Hard-drive-upgrade-to-NVMe-SSD-1TB-for-HP-Pavilion-15-cc1xx/td-p/7881517).
    
3. Optionally, add a SATA SSD for additional storage needs2.
    

These upgrades are straightforward, cost-effective, and will noticeably extend the useful life and performance of your HP Pavilion 15-cc1xx.
