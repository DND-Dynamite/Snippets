To access a Google Drive folder within Obsidian on Android, you'll need to ==use a third-party sync app or a method like "Autosync" to create a local mirror of the Google Drive folder that Obsidian can then treat as a vault==. Obsidian itself doesn't directly integrate with Google Drive to open folders, but you can use these methods to achieve similar results. 

Here's a breakdown of how you can sync your Obsidian vault with Google Drive on Android:

1. Choose a Sync Method:

- **Third-party sync apps:**
    
    Apps like Autosync or DriveSync can mirror a Google Drive folder to your local Android device. 
    
- **Install Google Drive on your desktop:**
    
    Install the Google Drive app on your computer (desktop) and set up the "Backup and Sync" feature to sync your Obsidian vault folder to your Google Drive. 
    

2. Set up the sync:

- **Create a folder on Google Drive:**
    
    Create a new folder in Google Drive where you want to store your Obsidian vault. 
    
- **If using a sync app, follow its instructions:**
    
    Configure the sync app to mirror the Google Drive folder to a local folder on your Android device. You can often customize sync settings like frequency and network conditions. 
    
- **If using Google Drive Backup and Sync, follow Google's instructions:**
    
    Ensure the correct folder is synced to Google Drive, and then install and configure the Google Drive app on your Android device. 
    

3. Create a vault in Obsidian:

- **Open Obsidian:** Launch the Obsidian app on your Android device.
- **Create a new vault:** In Obsidian, create a new vault and select the local folder that was synced from Google Drive.
- **Open as vault:** Choose the option to "Open folder as vault" to associate your synced folder with Obsidian. 

4. Sync and edit:

- **Changes will now sync:**
    
    Any changes you make in your Obsidian vault on either your Android device or your desktop (through Google Drive) will be synced between both devices.
    
- **You can now access and edit your notes:**
    
    You'll be able to access and edit your notes directly within Obsidian on Android, and they will be synced to your Google Drive and other devices. 
    

In summary: You can't directly open a Google Drive folder as a vault within Obsidian on Android. Instead, you need to use a third-party app or the Google Drive Backup and Sync to create a local copy of the Google Drive folder that Obsidian can then access and sync with.
